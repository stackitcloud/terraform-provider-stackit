# {{ .ProviderShortName | upper }} Terraform Provider

The STACKIT Terraform provider is the official Terraform provider to integrate all the resources developed by [STACKIT](https://www.stackit.de/en/).

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

## Authentication

To authenticate, you will need a [service account](https://docs.stackit.cloud/platform/access-and-identity/service-accounts/). Create it in the [STACKIT Portal](https://portal.stackit.cloud/) and assign the necessary permissions to it, e.g. `project.owner`. There are multiple ways to authenticate:

- Workload Identity Federation
- Key flow 

When setting up authentication, the provider will always try to use the workload identity federation flow first and search for credentials in several locations, following a specific order:

1. Explicit configuration, e.g. by setting the field `use_oidc` in the provider block (see example below)
2. Environment variable, e.g. by setting `STACKIT_USE_OIDC`
3. Credentials file

   The provider will check the credentials file located in the path defined by the `STACKIT_CREDENTIALS_PATH` env var, if specified,
   or in `$HOME/.stackit/credentials.json` as a fallback.
   The credentials should be set using the same name as the environment variables. Example:

   ```json
   {
     "STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH": "path/to/sa_key.json",
     "STACKIT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH": "path/to/private_key.pem"
   }
   ```

### Workload Identity Federation

    The following instructions assume that you have created a service account and assigned the necessary permissions to it, e.g. `project.owner`.

When using Workload Identity Federation (WIF), you don't need a static service account secret or key. Instead, the provider exchanges a short-lived OIDC token (from GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.) for a STACKIT access token. This is the most secure way to authenticate in CI/CD environments as it eliminates the need for long-lived secrets.

WIF can be configured to trust any public OIDC provider following the [official documentation](https://docs.stackit.cloud/platform/access-and-identity/service-accounts/how-tos/manage-service-account-federations/#create-a-federated-identity-provider).

To use WIF, set the `use_oidc` flag to `true` and provide an OIDC token for the exchange. While you can provide the token directly via `service_account_federated_token`, this is **not recommended for GitHub Actions**, as the provider will automatically fetch the token from the environment. For a complete setup, see our [Workload Identity Federation guide](./guides/workload_identity_federation.md).

In addition to this, you must set the `service_account_email` to specify which service account to impersonate.

### Key flow

    The following instructions assume that you have created a service account and assigned the necessary permissions to it, e.g. `project.owner`.

To use the key flow, you need to have a service account key, which must have an RSA key-pair attached to it.

When creating the service account key, a new pair can be created automatically, which will be included in the service account key. This will make it much easier to configure the key flow authentication in the [STACKIT Terraform Provider](https://github.com/stackitcloud/terraform-provider-stackit), by just providing the service account key.

**Optionally**, you can provide your own private key when creating the service account key, which will then require you to also provide it explicitly to the [STACKIT Terraform Provider](https://github.com/stackitcloud/terraform-provider-stackit), additionally to the service account key. Check the STACKIT Docs for an [example of how to create your own key-pair](https://docs.stackit.cloud/platform/access-and-identity/service-accounts/how-tos/manage-service-account-keys/).

To configure the key flow, follow these steps:

1.  Create a service account key:

- Use the [STACKIT Portal](https://portal.stackit.cloud/): go to the `Service Accounts` tab, choose a `Service Account` and go to `Service Account Keys` to create a key. For more details, see [Create a service account key](https://docs.stackit.cloud/platform/access-and-identity/service-accounts/how-tos/manage-service-account-keys/)

2.  Save the content of the service account key by copying it and saving it in a JSON file.

    The expected format of the service account key is a **JSON** with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "publicKey": "public key",
  "createdAt": "2023-08-24T14:15:22Z",
  "validUntil": "2023-08-24T14:15:22Z",
  "keyType": "USER_MANAGED",
  "keyOrigin": "USER_PROVIDED",
  "keyAlgorithm": "RSA_2048",
  "active": true,
  "credentials": {
    "kid": "string",
    "iss": "my-sa@sa.stackit.cloud",
    "sub": "uuid",
    "aud": "string",
    (optional) "privateKey": "private key when generated by the SA service"
  }
}
```

3. Configure the service account key for authentication in the provider by following one of the alternatives below:

   - setting the fields in the provider block: `service_account_key` or `service_account_key_path`
   - setting the environment variable: `STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH`
   - setting `STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH` in the credentials file (see above)

> **Optionally, only if you have provided your own RSA key-pair when creating the service account key**, you also need to configure your private key (takes precedence over the one included in the service account key, if present). **The private key must be PEM encoded** and can be provided using one of the options below:
>
> - setting the field in the provider block: `private_key` or `private_key_path`
> - setting the environment variable: `STACKIT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`
> - setting `STACKIT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` in the credentials file (see above)

# Backend configuration

To keep track of your terraform state, you can configure an [S3 backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3) using [STACKIT Object Storage](https://docs.stackit.cloud/products/storage/object-storage).

To do so, you need an Object Storage [S3 bucket](https://docs.stackit.cloud/products/storage/object-storage/basics/concepts/#buckets) and [credentials](https://docs.stackit.cloud/products/storage/object-storage/basics/concepts/#credentials) to access it. If you need to create them, check [Create and delete Object Storage buckets](https://docs.stackit.cloud/products/storage/object-storage/how-tos/create-and-manage-object-storage-buckets/) and [Create and delete Object Storage credentials](https://docs.stackit.cloud/products/storage/object-storage/how-tos/create-and-delete-object-storage-credentials/).

Once you have everything setup, you can configure the backend by adding the following block to your terraform configuration:

```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "BUCKET_NAME"
    key    = "path/to/key"
    endpoints = {
      s3 = "https://object.storage.eu01.onstackit.cloud"
    }
    region                      = "eu01"
    skip_credentials_validation = true
    skip_region_validation      = true
    skip_s3_checksum            = true
    skip_requesting_account_id  = true
    secret_key                  = "SECRET_KEY"
    access_key                  = "ACCESS_KEY"
  }
}
```

Note: AWS specific checks must be skipped as they do not work on STACKIT. For details on what those validations do, see [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3#configuration).
