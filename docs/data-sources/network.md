- `id` (String) Terraform's internal resource ID. It is structured as "`project_id`,`network_id`".
- `ipv4_gateway` (String) The IPv4 gateway of a network. If not specified, the first IP of the network will be assigned as the gateway.
- `ipv4_nameservers` (List of String) The IPv4 nameservers of the network.
- `ipv4_prefix` (String) The IPv4 prefix of the network (CIDR).
- `ipv4_prefix_length` (Number) The IPv4 prefix length of the network.
- `ipv4_prefixes` (List of String) The IPv4 prefixes of the network.
