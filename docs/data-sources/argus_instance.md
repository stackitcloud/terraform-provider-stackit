<a id="nestedatt--alert_config--route"></a>
### Nested Schema for `alert_config.route`

Read-Only:

- `group_by` (List of String) The labels by which incoming alerts are grouped together. For example, multiple alerts coming in for cluster=A and alertname=LatencyHigh would be batched into a single group. To aggregate by all possible labels use the special value '...' as the sole label name, for example: group_by: ['...']. This effectively disables aggregation entirely, passing through all alerts as-is. This is unlikely to be what you want, unless you have a very low alert volume or your upstream notification system performs its own grouping.
- `group_interval` (String) How long to wait before sending a notification about new alerts that are added to a group of alerts for which an initial notification has already been sent. (Usually ~5m or more.)
- `group_wait` (String) How long to initially wait to send a notification for a group of alerts. Allows to wait for an inhibiting alert to arrive or collect more initial alerts for the same group. (Usually ~0s to few minutes.) .
- `match` (Map of String) A set of equality matchers an alert has to fulfill to match the node.
- `match_regex` (Map of String) A set of regex-matchers an alert has to fulfill to match the node.
- `receiver` (String) The name of the receiver to route the alerts to.
- `repeat_interval` (String) How long to wait before sending a notification again if it has already been sent successfully for an alert. (Usually ~3h or more).
- `routes` (Attributes List) List of child routes. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--alert_config--route--routes))
