# stackit_logme_instance (Data Source)

LogMe instance data source schema. Uses the `default_region` specified in the provider configuration as a fallback in case no `region` is defined on resource level.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "stackit_logme_instance" "example" {
  project_id  = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  instance_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `instance_id` (String) ID of the LogMe instance.
- `project_id` (String) STACKIT Project ID to which the instance is associated.

### Read-Only

- `cf_guid` (String)
- `cf_organization_guid` (String)
- `cf_space_guid` (String)
- `dashboard_url` (String)
- `id` (String) Terraform's internal data source. identifier. It is structured as "`project_id`,`instance_id`".
- `image_url` (String)
- `name` (String) Instance name.
- `parameters` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--parameters))

### Nested Schema for `parameters`

Read-Only:

- `enable_monitoring` (Boolean) Enable monitoring.
- `fluentd_tcp` (Number)
- `fluentd_tls` (Number)
- `fluentd_tls_ciphers` (String)
- `fluentd_tls_max_version` (String)
- `fluentd_tls_min_version` (String)
- `fluentd_tls_version` (String)
- `fluentd_udp` (Number)
- `graphite` (String) If set, monitoring with Graphite will be enabled. Expects the host and port where the Graphite metrics should be sent to (host:port).
- `ism_deletion_after` (String) Combination of an integer and a timerange when an index will be considered "old" and can be deleted. Possible values for the timerange are `s`, `m`, `h` and `d`.
- `ism_jitter` (Number)

- `java_maxmetaspace` (Number) The amount of memory (in MB) used by the JVM to store metadata for OpenSearch.
- `max_disk_threshold` (Number) The maximum disk threshold in MB. If the disk usage exceeds this threshold, the instance will be stopped.
- `metrics_frequency` (Number) The frequency in seconds at which metrics are emitted (in seconds).
- `metrics_prefix` (String) The prefix for the metrics. Could be useful when using Graphite monitoring to prefix the metrics with a certain value, like an API key.
