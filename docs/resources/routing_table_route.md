# stackit_routing_table_route (Resource)

Routing table route resource schema. Must have a `region` specified in the provider configuration.

~> This resource is part of the routing-tables experiment and is likely going to undergo significant changes or be removed in the future. Use it at your own discretion.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "stackit_routing_table_route" "example" {
  organization_id  = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  network_area_id  = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  routing_table_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  destination = {
    type  = "cidrv4"
    value = "192.168.178.0/24"
  }
  next_hop = {
    type  = "ipv4"
    value = "192.168.178.1"
  }
  labels = {
    "key" = "value"
  }
}

# Only use the import statement, if you want to import an existing routing table route
import {
  to = stackit_routing_table_route.import-example
  id = "${var.organization_id},${var.region},${var.network_area_id},${var.routing_table_id},${var.routing_table_route_id}"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `destination` (Attributes) Destination of the route. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--destination))
- `network_area_id` (String) The network area ID to which the routing table is associated.
- `next_hop` (Attributes) Next hop destination. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--next_hop))
- `organization_id` (String) STACKIT organization ID to which the routing table is associated.
- `routing_table_id` (String) The routing tables ID.

### Optional

- `labels` (Map of String) Labels are key-value string pairs which can be attached to a resource container
- `region` (String) The resource region. If not defined, the provider region is used.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Date-time when the route was created.
- `id` (String) Terraform's internal resource ID. It is structured as "`organization_id`,`region`,`network_area_id`,`routing_table_id`,`route_id`".
- `route_id` (String) The ID of the route.
- `updated_at` (String) Date-time when the route was updated.

- `value` (String) An CIDR string.


<a id="nestedatt--next_hop"></a>
### Nested Schema for `next_hop`

Required:

- `type` (String) Type of the next hop. Possible values are: `blackhole`, `internet`, `ipv4`, `ipv6`.
