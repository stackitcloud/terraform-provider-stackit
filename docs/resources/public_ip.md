## Schema

### Required

- `project_id` (String) STACKIT project ID to which the public IP is associated.

### Optional

- `labels` (Map of String) Labels are key-value string pairs which can be attached to a resource container
- `network_interface_id` (String) Associates the public IP with a network interface or a virtual IP (ID). If you are using this resource with a Kubernetes Load Balancer or any other resource which associates a network interface implicitly, use the lifecycle `ignore_changes` property in this field to prevent unintentional removal of the network interface due to drift in the Terraform state

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Terraform's internal resource ID. It is structured as "`project_id`,`public_ip_id`".
- `ip` (String) The IP address.
- `public_ip_id` (String) The public IP ID.
