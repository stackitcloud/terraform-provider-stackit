## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "stackit_security_group_rule" "example" {
  project_id        = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  security_group_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  direction         = "ingress"
  icmp_parameters = {
    code = 0
    type = 8
  }
  protocol = {
    name   = "name"
    number = 1
  }
  port_range = {
    max = 22
    min = 22
  }
}
