# stackit_rabbitmq_instance (Resource)

RabbitMQ instance resource schema. Must have a `region` specified in the provider configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "stackit_rabbitmq_instance" "example" {
  project_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  name       = "example-instance"
  version    = "3.13"
  plan_name  = "stackit-rabbitmq-1.2.10-replica"
  parameters = {
    sgw_acl           = "193.148.160.0/19,45.129.40.0/21,45.135.244.0/22"
    consumer_timeout  = 18000000
    enable_monitoring = false

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Instance name.
- `plan_name` (String) The selected plan name.
- `project_id` (String) STACKIT project ID to which the instance is associated.
- `version` (String) The service version.

### Optional

- `parameters` (Attributes) Configuration parameters. Please note that removing a previously configured field from your Terraform configuration won't replace its value in the API. To update a previously configured field, explicitly set a new value for it. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--parameters))

### Read-Only

- `cf_guid` (String)
- `cf_organization_guid` (String)
- `cf_space_guid` (String)
- `dashboard_url` (String)
- `id` (String) Terraform's internal resource ID. It is structured as "`project_id`,`instance_id`".
- `image_url` (String)
- `instance_id` (String) ID of the RabbitMQ instance.
- `plan_id` (String) The selected plan ID.

### Nested Schema for `parameters`

Optional:

- `consumer_timeout` (Number) The timeout in milliseconds for the consumer.
- `enable_monitoring` (Boolean) Enable monitoring.
- `graphite` (String) Graphite server URL (host and port). If set, monitoring with Graphite will be enabled.

- `metrics_frequency` (Number) The frequency in seconds at which metrics are emitted.
- `metrics_prefix` (String) The prefix for the metrics. Could be useful when using Graphite monitoring to prefix the metrics with a certain value, like an API key
- `monitoring_instance_id` (String) The ID of the STACKIT monitoring instance.
- `plugins` (List of String) List of plugins to install. Must be a supported plugin name.
- `roles` (List of String) List of roles to assign to the instance.
- `sgw_acl` (String) Comma separated list of IP networks in CIDR notation which are allowed to access this instance.
