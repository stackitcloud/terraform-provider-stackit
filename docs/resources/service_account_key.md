# stackit_service_account_key (Resource)

Service account access key schema.

~> This resource is in beta and may be subject to breaking changes in the future. Use with caution. See our [guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/stackitcloud/stackit/latest/docs/guides/opting_into_beta_resources) for how to opt-in to use beta resources.
## Example Usage


### Automatically rotate service account keys
```terraform
resource "stackit_service_account" "sa" {
  project_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  name       = "sa01"
}

resource "time_rotating" "rotate" {
  rotation_days = 80
}

resource "stackit_service_account_key" "sa_key" {
  project_id            = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  service_account_email = stackit_service_account.sa.email
  ttl_days              = 90

  rotate_when_changed = {
    rotation = time_rotating.rotate.id
  }	
}

```

## Schema

### Required

- `project_id` (String) The STACKIT project ID associated with the service account key.
- `service_account_email` (String) The email address associated with the service account, used for account identification and communication.

### Optional

- `public_key` (String) Specifies the public_key (RSA2048 key-pair). If not provided, a certificate from STACKIT will be used to generate a private_key.
- `rotate_when_changed` (Map of String) A map of arbitrary key/value pairs designed to force key recreation when they change, facilitating key rotation based on external factors such as a changing timestamp. Modifying this map triggers the creation of a new resource.
- `ttl_days` (Number) Specifies the key's validity duration in days. If left unspecified, the key is considered valid until it is deleted

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Terraform's internal resource identifier. It is structured as "`project_id`,`service_account_email`,`key_id`".
- `json` (String, Sensitive) The raw JSON representation of the service account key json, available for direct use.
- `key_id` (String) The unique identifier for the key associated with the service account.
