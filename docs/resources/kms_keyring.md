# stackit_kms_keyring (Resource)

KMS Keyring resource schema. Uses the `default_region` specified in the provider configuration as a fallback in case no `region` is defined on resource level.

 ~> Keyrings will **not** be destroyed by terraform during a `terraform destroy`. They will just be thrown out of the Terraform state and not deleted on API side. **This way we can ensure no keyring setups are deleted by accident and it gives you the option to recover your keys within the grace period.**

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "stackit_kms_keyring" "example" {
  project_id   = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  display_name = "example-name"
  description  = "example description"
}
```
