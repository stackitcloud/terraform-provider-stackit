## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Project name.
- `parent_container_id` (String) Parent resource identifier. Both container ID (user-friendly) and UUID are supported

### Optional

- `labels` (Map of String) Labels are key-value string pairs which can be attached to a resource container. A label key must match the regex [A-ZÄÜÖa-zäüöß0-9_-]{1,64}. A label value must match the regex ^$|[A-ZÄÜÖa-zäüöß0-9_-]{1,64}
- `members` (Attributes List) The members assigned to the project. At least one subject needs to be a user, and not a client or service account. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--members))
- `owner_email` (String, Deprecated) Email address of the owner of the project. This value is only considered during creation. Changing it afterwards will have no effect.

!> The "owner_email" field has been deprecated in favor of the "members" field. Please use the "members" field to assign the owner role to a user, by setting the "role" field to `owner`.

### Read-Only

- `container_id` (String) Project container ID. Globally unique, user-friendly identifier.
- `id` (String) Terraform's internal resource ID. It is structured as "`container_id`".
- `project_id` (String) Project UUID identifier. This is the ID that can be used in most of the other resources to identify the project.

<a id="nestedatt--members"></a>
### Nested Schema for `members`

Required:

- `role` (String) A valid role defined for the resource. At least one users must have the `owner` role. Legacy roles (`project.admin`, `project.auditor`, `project.member`, `project.owner`) are not supported.
- `subject` (String) Unique identifier of the user, service account or client. This is usually the email address for users or service accounts, and the name in case of clients.
