# stackit_resourcemanager_project (Resource)

Resource Manager project resource schema.

-> In case you're getting started with an empty STACKIT organization and want to use this resource to create projects in it, check out [this guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/stackitcloud/stackit/latest/docs/guides/stackit_org_service_account) for how to create a service account which you can use for authentication in the STACKIT Terraform provider.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "stackit_resourcemanager_project" "example" {
  parent_container_id = "example-parent-container-abc123"
  name                = "example-container"
  labels = {
    "Label 1" = "foo"
    // "networkArea" = stackit_network_area.foo.network_area_id
  }
  owner_email = "john.doe@stackit.cloud"
}

# Only use the import statement, if you want to import an existing resourcemanager project
# Note: There will be a conflict which needs to be resolved manually.
# Must set a configuration value for the owner_email attribute as the provider has marked it as required.
import {
  to = stackit_resourcemanager_project.import-example
  id = var.container_id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Project name.
- `owner_email` (String) Email address of the owner of the project. This value is only considered during creation. Changing it afterwards will have no effect.
- `parent_container_id` (String) Parent resource identifier. Both container ID (user-friendly) and UUID are supported

### Optional

- `labels` (Map of String) Labels are key-value string pairs which can be attached to a resource container. A label key must match the regex [A-ZÄÜÖa-zäüöß0-9_-]{1,64}. A label value must match the regex ^$|[A-ZÄÜÖa-zäüöß0-9_-]{1,64}.  
To create a project within a STACKIT Network Area, setting the label `networkArea=<networkAreaID>` is required. This can not be changed after project creation.

### Read-Only

- `container_id` (String) Project container ID. Globally unique, user-friendly identifier.
- `creation_time` (String) Date-time at which the folder was created.
- `id` (String) Terraform's internal resource ID. It is structured as "`container_id`".
- `project_id` (String) Project UUID identifier. This is the ID that can be used in most of the other resources to identify the project.
- `update_time` (String) Date-time at which the folder was last modified.
