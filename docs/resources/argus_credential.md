!> The `stackit_argus_credential` resource has been deprecated and will be removed after February 26th 2025. Please use `stackit_observability_credential` instead, which offers the exact same functionality.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "stackit_argus_credential" "example" {
  project_id  = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  instance_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}

### Example move

#	Example to move the deprecated `stackit_argus_credential` resource to the new `stackit_observability_credential` resource:
#	1. Add a new `stackit_observability_credential` resource with the same values like your previous `stackit_argus_credential` resource.
#	2. Add a moved block which reference the `stackit_argus_credential` and `stackit_observability_credential` resource.
#	3. Remove your old `stackit_argus_credential` resource and run `$ terraform apply`.

resource "stackit_argus_credential" "example" {
	project_id  = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
	instance_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}

moved {
	from = stackit_argus_credential.example
	to = stackit_observability_credential.example
}

resource "stackit_observability_credential" "example" {
