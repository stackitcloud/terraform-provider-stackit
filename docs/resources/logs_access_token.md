# stackit_logs_access_token (Resource)

Logs access token resource schema.

~> This resource is in beta and may be subject to breaking changes in the future. Use with caution. See our [guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/stackitcloud/stackit/latest/docs/guides/opting_into_beta_resources) for how to opt-in to use beta resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "stackit_logs_access_token" "accessToken" {
  project_id   = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  instance_id  = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  region       = "eu01"
  display_name = "logs-access-token-example"
  permissions = [
    "read"
  ]
}

resource "stackit_logs_access_token" "accessToken2" {
  project_id   = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  instance_id  = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  region       = "eu01"
  display_name = "logs-access-token-example"
  lifetime     = 30
  permissions = [
    "write"
  ]
  description = "Example description"
}

# Only use the import statement, if you want to import an existing logs access token
# Note: The generated access token is only available upon creation.
# Since this attribute is not fetched from the API call, to prevent the conflicts, you need to add:
# lifecycle {
#   ignore_changes = [ lifetime ]
# }
import {
  to = stackit_logs_access_token.import-example
  id = "${var.project_id},${var.region},${var.logs_instance_id},${var.logs_access_token_id}"
}
```
