# stackit_objectstorage_credentials_group (Resource)

ObjectStorage credentials group resource schema. Must have a `region` specified in the provider configuration. If you are creating `credentialsgroup` and `bucket` resources simultaneously, please include the `depends_on` field so that they are created sequentially. This prevents errors from concurrent calls to the service enablement that is done in the background.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "stackit_objectstorage_credentials_group" "example" {
  project_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  name       = "example-credentials-group"
}

# Only use the import statement, if you want to import an existing objectstorage credential group
import {
  to = stackit_objectstorage_credentials_group.import-example
  id = "${var.project_id},${var.region},${var.bucket_credentials_group_id}"
}
```
