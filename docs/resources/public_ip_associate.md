# stackit_public_ip_associate (Resource)

Associates an existing public IP to a network interface. This is useful for situations where you have a pre-allocated public IP or unable to use the `stackit_public_ip` resource to create a new public IP. Must have a `region` specified in the provider configuration.
The `stackit_public_ip_associate` resource should not be used together with the `stackit_public_ip` resource if both of them are declaring the network_interface_id. If both resources declare the same network_interface_id, they have control of the `stackit_network_interface` association simultaneously and this might lead to conflicts.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "stackit_public_ip_associate" "example" {
  project_id           = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  public_ip_id         = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  network_interface_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```
