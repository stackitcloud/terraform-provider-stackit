# stackit_public_ip_associate (Resource)

Associates an existing public IP to a network interface. This is useful for situations where you have a pre-allocated public IP or unable to use the `stackit_public_ip` resource to create a new public IP. Must have a `region` specified in the provider configuration.

!> The `stackit_public_ip_associate` resource should not be used together with the `stackit_public_ip` resource for the same public IP or for the same network interface. 
Using both resources together for the same public IP or network interface WILL lead to conflicts, as they both have control of the public IP and network interface association.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "stackit_public_ip_associate" "example" {
  project_id           = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  public_ip_id         = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  network_interface_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}

# Only use the import statement, if you want to import an existing public ip associate
import {
  to = stackit_public_ip_associate.import-example
  id = "${var.project_id},${var.region},${var.public_ip_id},${var.network_interface_id}"
}
```
