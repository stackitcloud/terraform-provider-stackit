- `project_id` (String) STACKIT project ID to which the instance is associated.
- `version` (String) The service version.

### Optional

- `parameters` (Attributes) Configuration parameters. Please note that removing a previously configured field from your Terraform configuration won't replace its value in the API. To update a previously configured field, explicitly set a new value for it. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--parameters))

### Read-Only

- `cf_guid` (String)
- `cf_organization_guid` (String)
- `cf_space_guid` (String)
- `dashboard_url` (String)
