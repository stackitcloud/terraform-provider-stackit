## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Instance name.
- `plan_name` (String) The selected plan name.
- `project_id` (String) STACKIT project ID to which the instance is associated.
- `version` (String) The service version.

### Optional

- `parameters` (Attributes) Configuration parameters. Since the API only allows updating these through a PATCH request, removing a previsouly configured field from your Terraform configuration won't replace its value in the API. To update a previously configured field, please explicitly set a new value for it. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--parameters))

### Read-Only

- `cf_guid` (String)
- `cf_organization_guid` (String)
- `cf_space_guid` (String)
- `dashboard_url` (String)
- `id` (String) Terraform's internal resource ID. It is structured as "`project_id`,`instance_id`".
- `image_url` (String)
- `instance_id` (String) ID of the MariaDB instance.
- `plan_id` (String) The selected plan ID.

- `enable_monitoring` (Boolean) Enable monitoring.
- `graphite` (String) Graphite server URL (host and port). If set, monitoring with Graphite will be enabled.

- `metrics_frequency` (Number) The frequency in seconds at which metrics are emitted.
- `metrics_prefix` (String) The prefix for the metrics. Could be useful when using Graphite monitoring to prefix the metrics with a certain value, like an API key
- `monitoring_instance_id` (String) The ID of the STACKIT monitoring instance.
- `sgw_acl` (String) Comma separated list of IP networks in CIDR notation which are allowed to access this instance.
