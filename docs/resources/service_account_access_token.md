# stackit_service_account_access_token (Resource)

Schema for a STACKIT service account access token resource.

~> This resource is in beta and may be subject to breaking changes in the future. Use with caution. See our [guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/stackitcloud/stackit/latest/docs/guides/opting_into_beta_resources) for how to opt-in to use beta resources.
## Example Usage


### Automatically rotate access tokens
```terraform
resource "stackit_service_account" "sa" {
  project_id = var.stackit_project_id
  name       = "sa01"
}

resource "time_rotating" "rotate" {
  rotation_days = 80
}

// The access token is valid for 180 days but is configured to rotate every 80 days
// when a Terraform apply is triggered.
resource "stackit_service_account_access_token" "sa1" {
  project_id            = var.stackit_project_id
  service_account_email = stackit_service_account.sa.email
  ttl_days              = 180

  // Trigger token rotation based on time_rotating changes.
  rotate_when_changed = {
    rotation = time_rotating.rotate.id
  }
}

```

## Schema

### Required

- `project_id` (String) STACKIT project ID associated with the service account token.
- `service_account_email` (String) Email address linked to the service account.

### Optional

- `rotate_when_changed` (Map of String) A map of arbitrary key/value pairs that will force recreation of the token when they change, enabling token rotation based on external conditions such as a rotating timestamp. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
- `ttl_days` (Number) Specifies the token's validity duration in days. If unspecified, defaults to 90 days.

### Read-Only

- `access_token_id` (String) Identifier for the access token linked to the service account.
- `created_at` (String) Timestamp indicating when the access token was created.
- `id` (String) Unique internal resource ID for Terraform, formatted as "project_id,access_token_id".
- `token` (String, Sensitive) JWT access token for API authentication. Prefixed by 'Bearer' and should be stored securely as it is irretrievable once lost.
- `valid_until` (String) Estimated expiration timestamp of the access token. For precise validity, check the JWT details.
