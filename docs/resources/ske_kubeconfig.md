## Schema

### Required

- `cluster_name` (String) Name of the SKE cluster.
- `project_id` (String) STACKIT project ID to which the cluster is associated.

### Optional

- `expiration` (Number) Expiration time of the kubeconfig, in seconds. Defaults to `3600`
- `refresh` (Boolean) If set to true, the provider will check if the kubeconfig has expired and will generated a new valid one in-place
- `refresh_before` (Number) Number of seconds before expiration to trigger refresh of the kubeconfig at. Only used if refresh is set to true.
- `region` (String) The resource region. If not defined, the provider region is used.

### Read-Only

- `creation_time` (String) Date-time when the kubeconfig was created
- `expires_at` (String) Timestamp when the kubeconfig expires
- `id` (String) Terraform's internal resource ID. It is structured as "`project_id`,`cluster_name`,`kube_config_id`".
- `kube_config` (String, Sensitive) Raw short-lived admin kubeconfig.
- `kube_config_id` (String) Internally generated UUID to identify a kubeconfig resource in Terraform, since the SKE API doesnt return a kubeconfig identifier
