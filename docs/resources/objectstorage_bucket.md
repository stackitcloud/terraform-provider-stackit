  ObjectStorage bucket resource schema. Uses the default_region specified in the provider configuration as a fallback in case no region is defined on resource level. If you are creating credentialsgroup and bucket resources simultaneously, please include the depends_on field so that they are created sequentially.

# stackit_objectstorage_bucket (Resource)

ObjectStorage bucket resource schema. Uses the `default_region` specified in the provider configuration as a fallback in case no `region` is defined on resource level. If you are creating `credentialsgroup` and `bucket` resources simultaneously, please include the `depends_on` field so that they are created sequentially. This prevents errors from concurrent calls to the service enablement that is done in the background.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "stackit_objectstorage_bucket" "example" {
  project_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  name       = "example-bucket"
}

# Only use the import statement, if you want to import an existing objectstorage bucket
import {
  to = stackit_objectstorage_bucket.import-example
  id = "${var.project_id},${var.region},${var.bucket_name}"
}
```
