# stackit_cdn_distribution (Resource)

CDN distribution data source schema.

~> This resource is in beta and may be subject to breaking changes in the future. Use with caution. See our [guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/stackitcloud/stackit/latest/docs/guides/opting_into_beta_resources) for how to opt-in to use beta resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "stackit_cdn_distribution" "example_distribution" {
  project_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  config = {
    backend = {
      type       = "http"
      origin_url = "https://mybackend.onstackit.cloud"
      geofencing = {
        "https://mybackend.onstackit.cloud" = ["DE"]
      }
    }
    regions           = ["EU", "US", "ASIA", "AF", "SA"]
    blocked_countries = ["DE", "AT", "CH"]

    optimizer = {
      enabled = true
    }
  }
}

resource "stackit_cdn_distribution" "example_bucket_distribution" {
  project_id = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
  config = {
    backend = {
      type       = "bucket"
      bucket_url = "https://my-test.object.storage.eu01.onstackit.cloud"
      region     = "eu01"

      # Credentials are required for bucket backends
      # It is strongly recommended to use variables for secrets
      credentials = {
        access_key_id     = var.bucket_access_key
        secret_access_key = var.bucket_secret_key
      }
    }
    regions           = ["EU", "US"]
    blocked_countries = ["CN", "RU"]

    optimizer = {
      enabled = false
    }
  }
}

# Only use the import statement, if you want to import an existing cdn distribution
import {
  to = stackit_cdn_distribution.import-example
  id = "${var.project_id},${var.distribution_id}"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `config` (Attributes) The distribution configuration (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config))
- `project_id` (String) STACKIT project ID associated with the distribution

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Time when the distribution was created
- `distribution_id` (String) CDN distribution ID
- `domains` (Attributes List) List of configured domains for the distribution (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--domains))
- `errors` (List of String) List of distribution errors
- `id` (String) Terraform's internal resource identifier. It is structured as "`project_id`,`distribution_id`".
- `status` (String) Status of the distribution
- `updated_at` (String) Time when the distribution was last updated

<a id="nestedatt--config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config`

Required:

- `backend` (Attributes) The configured backend for the distribution (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--backend))
- `regions` (List of String) The configured regions where content will be hosted

Optional:

- `blocked_countries` (List of String) The configured countries where distribution of content is blocked
- `optimizer` (Attributes) Configuration for the Image Optimizer. This is a paid feature that automatically optimizes images to reduce their file size for faster delivery, leading to improved website performance and a better user experience. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--optimizer))

<a id="nestedatt--config--backend"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config.backend`

Required:

- `type` (String) The configured backend type. Possible values are: `http`, `bucket`.

Optional:

- `bucket_url` (String) The URL of the bucket (e.g. https://s3.example.com). Required if type is 'bucket'.
- `credentials` (Attributes) The credentials for the bucket. Required if type is 'bucket'. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--backend--credentials))
- `geofencing` (Map of List of String) The configured type http to configure countries where content is allowed. A map of URLs to a list of countries
- `origin_request_headers` (Map of String) The configured type http origin request headers for the backend
- `origin_url` (String) The configured backend type http for the distribution
- `region` (String) The region where the bucket is hosted. Required if type is 'bucket'.

<a id="nestedatt--config--backend--credentials"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config.backend.credentials`

Required:

- `access_key_id` (String, Sensitive) The access key for the bucket. Required if type is 'bucket'.
- `secret_access_key` (String, Sensitive) The access key for the bucket. Required if type is 'bucket'.



<a id="nestedatt--config--optimizer"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config.optimizer`

Optional:

- `enabled` (Boolean)



<a id="nestedatt--domains"></a>
### Nested Schema for `domains`

Read-Only:

- `errors` (List of String) List of domain errors
- `name` (String) The name of the domain
- `status` (String) The status of the domain
- `type` (String) The type of the domain. Each distribution has one domain of type "managed", and domains of type "custom" may be additionally created by the user
