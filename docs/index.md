# STACKIT Provider

The STACKIT provider is the official Terraform provider to integrate all the resources developed by STACKIT.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "stackit" {
  region = "eu01"
}

# Authentication

# Token flow
provider "stackit" {
  region                = "eu01"
  service_account_token = var.service_account_token
}

# Key flow
provider "stackit" {
  region              = "eu01"
  service_account_key = var.service_account_key
  private_key         = var.private_key
}

# Key flow (using path)
provider "stackit" {
  region                   = "eu01"
  service_account_key_path = var.service_account_key_path
  private_key_path         = var.private_key_path
}
```

## Authentication

To authenticate, you will need a [service account](https://docs.stackit.cloud/stackit/en/service-accounts-134415819.html). Create it in the STACKIT Portal an assign it the necessary permissions, e.g. `project.owner`. There are multiple ways to authenticate:

- Key flow (recommended)
- Token flow

When setting up authentication, the provider will always try to use the key flow first and search for credentials in several locations, following a specific order:

1. Explicit configuration, e.g. by seting the field `stackit_service_account_key_path` in the provider block (see example below)
2. Environment variable, e.g. by setting `STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH`
3. Credentials file

   The SDK will check the credentials file located in the path defined by the `STACKIT_CREDENTIALS_PATH` env var, if specified,
   or in `$HOME/.stackit/credentials.json` as a fallback.
   The credentials should be set using the same name as the environment variables. Example:

   ```json
   {
     "STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN": "foo_token",
     "STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH": "path/to/sa_key.json",
     "STACKIT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH": "path/to/private_key.pem"
   }
   ```

### Key flow

To use the key flow, you need to have a service account key and an RSA key-pair.
To configure it, follow this steps:

    The following instructions assume that you have created a service account and assigned it the necessary permissions, e.g. project.owner.

1.  In the Portal, go to the `Service Accounts` tab, choose a `Service Account` and go to `Service Account Keys` to create a key.

- You can create your own RSA key-pair or have the Portal generate one for you.

2.  Save the content of the service account key and the corresponding private key by copying them or saving them in a file.

    **Hint:** If you have generated the RSA key-pair using the Portal, you can save the private key in a PEM encoded file by downloading the service account key as a PEM file and using `openssl storeutl -keys <path/to/sa_key_pem_file> > private.key` to extract the private key from the service account key.

The expected format of the service account key is a **json** with the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "publicKey": "public key",
  "createdAt": "2023-08-24T14:15:22Z",
  "validUntil": "2023-08-24T14:15:22Z",
  "keyType": "USER_MANAGED",
  "keyOrigin": "USER_PROVIDED",
  "keyAlgorithm": "RSA_2048",
  "active": true,
  "credentials": {
    "kid": "string",
    "iss": "my-sa@sa.stackit.cloud",
    "sub": "uuid",
    "aud": "string",
    (optional) "privateKey": "private key when generated by the SA service"
  }
}
```

3. Configure the service account key and private key for authentication in the SDK by following one of the alternatives below:
   - setting the fiels in the provider block: `service_account_key` or `service_account_key_path`, `private_key` or `private_key_path`
   - setting environment variables: `STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH` and `STACKIT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`
   - setting `STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH` and `STACKIT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` in the credentials file (see above)

### Token flow

Using this flow is less secure since the token is long-lived. You can provide the token in several ways:

1. Setting the field `service_account_token` in the provider
2. Setting the environment variable `STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`
3. Setting it in the credentials file (see above)

# Backend configuration

To keep track of your terraform state, you can configure an [S3 backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3) using [STACKIT Object Storage](https://docs.stackit.cloud/stackit/en/object-storage-s3-compatible-71009778.html).

To do so, you need an Object Storage [S3 bucket](https://docs.stackit.cloud/stackit/en/basic-concept-objectstorage-71009785.html#BasicConceptObjectStorage-Buckets) and [credentials](https://docs.stackit.cloud/stackit/en/basic-concept-objectstorage-71009785.html#BasicConceptObjectStorage-Credentials) to access it. If you need to create them, check [Getting Started - Object Storage](https://docs.stackit.cloud/stackit/en/getting-started-objectstorage-71009792.html).

Once you have everything setup, you can configure the backend by adding the following block to your terraform configuration:

```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "BUCKET_NAME"
    key    = "path/to/key"
    endpoints = {
      s3 = "https://object.storage.eu01.onstackit.cloud"
    }
    region                      = "eu01"
    skip_credentials_validation = true
    skip_region_validation      = true
    skip_s3_checksum            = true
    skip_requesting_account_id  = true
    secret_key                  = "SECRET_KEY"
    access_key                  = "ACCESS_KEY"
  }
}
```

Note: AWS specific checks must be skipped as they do not work on STACKIT. For details on what those validations do, see [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3#configuration).
