# Configuring Beta Resources in the STACKIT Terraform Provider

## Overview

This guide explains how to opt into beta resources within the STACKIT Terraform provider. Beta resources are new services and features from STACKIT that are still in development and might not yet have a stable API.

Opting into beta functionality allows users to experiment with new features and services before their official release, without compromising the stability of other resources and the provider itself. However, it's important to remember that beta resources may not be as stable as fully released counterparts, so use them with caution and provide feedback to help improve these services.

## The Process of Opting into the Beta

To use beta resources in the STACKIT Terraform provider, you have two options:

### Option 1: Provider Configuration

Set the `enable_beta_resources` option in the provider configuration. This is a boolean attribute that can be either `true` or `false`.

```hcl
provider "stackit" {
  region                = "eu01"
  enable_beta_resources = true
}
```

### Option 2: Environment Variable

Set the `STACKIT_TF_ENABLE_BETA_RESOURCES` environment variable to `"true"` or `"false"`. Other values will be ignored and will produce a warning.

```sh
export STACKIT_TF_ENABLE_BETA_RESOURCES=true
```

-> The environment variable takes precedence over the provider configuration option. This means that if the `STACKIT_TF_ENABLE_BETA_RESOURCES` environment variable is set to a valid value (`"true"` or `"false"`), it will override the `enable_beta_resources` option specified in the provider configuration.
