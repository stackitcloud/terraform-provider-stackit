## Developer Guide

### Useful Make commands

These commands can be executed from the project root:

- `make project-tools`: get the required dependencies
- `make lint`: lint the code and examples
- `make generate-docs`: generate terraform documentation
- `make test`: run unit tests
- `make coverage`: create unit test coverage report (output file: `stackit/coverage.html`)
- `make test-acceptance-tf`: run acceptance tests

### Repository structure

The provider resources and data sources for the STACKIT services are located under `stackit/services`. Inside `stackit` you can find several other useful packages such as `validate` and `testutil`. Examples of usage of the provider are located under the `examples` folder.

We make use of the [Terraform Plugin Framework](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework) to write the Terraform provider. [Here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/providers-plugin-framework/providers-plugin-framework-provider) you can find a tutorial on how to implement a provider using this framework.

### Implementing a new resource

Let's suppose you want to want to implement a new resource `bar` of service `foo`:

1. You would start by creating a new folder `bar/` inside `stackit/internal/services/foo/`
2. Following with the creation of a file `resource.go` inside your new folder `stackit/internal/services/foo/bar/`
   1. The Go package should be similar to the service name, in this case `foo` would be an adequate package name
   2. Please refer to the [Resource file structure](./CONTRIBUTION.md/#resource-file-structure) section for details on the structure of the file itself
3. To register the new resource `bar` in the provider, add it to the `Resources` in `stackit/provider.go`, using the `NewBarResource` method
4. Add an example in `examples/resources/stackit_foo_bar/resource.tf` with an example configuration for the new resource, e.g.:
   ```hcl
    resource "stackit_foo_bar" "example" {
      project_id    = "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
      my_required_field      = "my-required-field-value"
      my_optional_field      = "my-optional-field-value"
    }
   ```

Please remeber to always add unit tests for the helper functions (in this case `mapFields` and `toCreatePayload`), as well implementing/extending the acceptance (end-to-end) tests. Our acceptance tests are implemented using Hashicorp's [terraform-plugin-testing](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/testing/acceptance-tests) package.

Additionally, remember to run `make generate-docs` after your changes to keep the commands' documentation in `docs/` updated, which is used as a source for the [Terraform Registry documentation page](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/stackitcloud/stackit/latest/docs).

#### Resource file structure

Below is a typical structure of a STACKIT Terraform provider resource:

https://github.com/stackitcloud/terraform-provider-stackit/blob/1b9225598a007cda8d8bcadf0db1836e96451353/.github/docs/contribution-guide/resource.go#L26-L295

If the new resource `bar` is the first resource in the TFP using a STACKIT service `foo`, please refer to [Onboarding a new STACKIT service](./CONTRIBUTION.md/#onboarding-a-new-stackit-service).

### Implementing a new datasource

The process to implement a new datasource is similar to [implementing a new resource](#implementing-a-new-resource). Some differences worth noting are:

- The datasource schema will have all attributes set as `Computed` only, with the exception of the ones needed to identify the datasource (usually are the same attributes used to compose the `id` field), which will be set as `Required`
- To register the new datasource bar in the provider, it should be added the `DataSources` in `stackit/provider.go`, using the `New...Datasource` method

### Onboarding a new STACKIT service

If you want to onboard resources of a STACKIT service `foo` that was not yet in the provider, you will need to do a few additional steps in `stackit/provider.go`:

1. Add `FooCustomEndpoint` fields to `providerModel` and `ProviderData` types, in `stackit/provider.go` and `stackit/internal/core/core.go`, respectively
2. Add a `foo_custom_endpoint` attribute to the provider's `Schema`, in `stackit/provider.go`
3. Check if the custom endpoint is defined and, if yes, use it. In the `Configure` method, add:
   ```go
   if !(providerConfig.FooCustomEndpoint.IsUnknown() || providerConfig.FooCustomEndpoint.IsNull()) {
     providerData.FooCustomEndpoint = providerConfig.FooCustomEndpoint.ValueString()
   }
   ```
4. Create a utils package, for service `foo` it would be `stackit/internal/foo/utils`. Add a `ConfigureClient()` func and use it in your resource and datasource implementations.

https://github.com/stackitcloud/terraform-provider-stackit/blob/1b9225598a007cda8d8bcadf0db1836e96451353/.github/docs/contribution-guide/utils/util.go#L14-L31

### Local development

To test your changes locally, you have to compile the provider (requires Go 1.24) and configure the Terraform CLI to use the local version.

1. Clone the repository.
1. Create a `.terraformrc` config file in your home directory (`~`) for the terraform CLI with the following content:

	```hcl
	provider_installation {
   	   dev_overrides {
	      "registry.terraform.io/stackitcloud/stackit" = "<PATH_TO_BINARY>"
	   }

	   # For all other providers, install them directly from their origin provider
	   # registries as normal. If you omit this, Terraform will _only_ use
	   # the dev_overrides block, and so no other providers will be available.
	   direct {}
	}
	```
1. Copy one of the folders in the [examples](examples/) folder to a location of your choosing, and define the Terraform variables according to its README. The main.tf file needs some additional configuration to use the local provider:

	```hcl
	terraform {
	   required_providers {
	      stackit = {
	         source = "registry.terraform.io/stackitcloud/stackit"
	      }
	   }
	}
	```

1. Go to the copied example and initialize Terraform by running `terraform init -reconfigure -upgrade`. This will throw an error ("Failed to query available provider packages") which can be ignored since we are using the local provider build.
   > Note: Terraform will store its resources' states locally. To allow multiple people to use the same resources, check [Setup for multi-person usage](#setup-centralized-terraform-state)
1. Setup authentication by setting the env var `STACKIT_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` as a valid token (see [Authentication](#authentication) for more details on how to autenticate).
1. Run `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` commands.
1. To debug the terraform provider, execute the following steps:
	* install the compiled terraform provider to binary path defined in the .terraformrc file
	* run the terraform provider from your IDE with the `-debug` flag set
	* The provider will emit the setting for the env variable `TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS`, e.g.

	```shell
		TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS='{"registry.terraform.io/stackitcloud/stackit":{"Protocol":"grpc","ProtocolVersion":6,"Pid":123456,"Test":true,"Addr":{"Network":"unix","String":"/tmp/plugin47110815"}}}'
	```

Starting terraform with this environment variable set will automatically connect to the running IDE session, instead of starting a new GRPC server with the plugin. This allows to set
breakpoints and inspect the state of the provider.
	


#### Setup centralized Terraform state

You'll need a storage bucket to store the Terraform state and a pair of access key/secret key.

- To order the bucket in the STACKIT Portal, go to Object Storage (on the right) > Buckets > Create bucket.
- To create credentials for a bucket in the STACKIT Portal, go Object Storage (on the right) > Credentials & Groups > Create credentials group.

In the main.tf file location, initialize Terraform by running the following:

```shell
terraform init -reconfigure -upgrade -backend-config="access_key=<STORAGE_BUCKET_ACCESS_KEY>" -backend-config="secret_key=<STORAGE_BUCKET_SECRET_KEY>"
```

This will throw an error ("Failed to query available provider packages") which can be ignored since we are using the local provider build.
